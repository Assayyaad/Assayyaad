# Game programming

The only game development engine I currently use is Unity engine, this engine is multi-purpose and can be used to build any kind of games.

It's worth noting that Unity's base engine is not enough to build a real game, you can use it for prototyping, but if you're going for a complete real game then you have to make your own custom Unity engine to build it, which can be time-consuming and requires a high skill level, or you can buy a bunch of tools from the Unity Asset Store.

# Bot programming

The most popular programming languages for Discord bots are JavaScript/TypeScript and Python, I personally use JavaScript/TypeScript and the tools I make for the Discord bots are built with it too.

If you've never used JavaScript/TypeScript before, let me recommend some learning resources that can help you get started.
