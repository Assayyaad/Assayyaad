# Learning resources

You can build discord bots with ease using Languages like JavaScript/TypeScript and Python, and since I'm using JavaScript/TypeScript then let me suggest you some cources to learn them from

### Codecademy

Codecademy is an online learning website focused on coding, with over 45 million users, created to teach programming in an engaging, effective way.
> They've recently added "Professional certificates" to their Pro subscription
